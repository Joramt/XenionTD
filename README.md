# XenionTD

## Introduction

Xenion TD is the final result of my Android craftmanship. The main goal is to build tower, upgrade them, let them aim & kill monster and collect money.

It's worth mentioning that a particular attention to the UI has been taken :
- A bar showing the number of monster present to the field
- a swipable menu that show your score / money / lives ( swipe left to open, right to close )
- a health indicator located top left corner
- a range indicator displayed whenever you click on any tower
- different board for different season ( green for sprint / summer, red for autumn, blue for winter )

You'll find 4 screenshot in the folder root.
It's a project that I plan to eventually release on the Google Store.
